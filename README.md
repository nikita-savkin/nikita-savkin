## Hey there :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

My name is Nikita, and I am a Frontend Developer with a serious passion for creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences.

I'm constantly challenging myself to learn new things. I believe that the best way to grow as a developer is to stay curious and keep pushing yourself to improve.

If you're interested in learning more about my work or simply want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me through [my portfolio](https://nikita-savkin.github.io)

I'm always excited to connect with other developers and enthusiasts who share my love for all things tech.
